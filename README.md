# Mood-Based Playlist Generator ðŸŽ§

## 1. Overview
This project is a mood-based music playlist generator built using Python and Streamlit. Users can select a mood (Happy, Sad, Energetic, Chill, Romantic), and the app will retrieve and visualize a playlist of YouTube music videos accordingly. The application uses the YouTube Data API to fetch video results and displays them through an interactive dashboard featuring thumbnail galleries, word clouds, and embedded players.

## 2. Requirements

- Required libraries:
  - streamlit
  - google-api-python-client
  - psutil
  - wordcloud

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Running the Project Locally

To launch the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the app in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501/`.

## 4. YouTube API Key Setup
