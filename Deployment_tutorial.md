# Deployment Tutorial: Ngrok & Streamlit Cloud

This guide explains how to deploy the Mood-Based Playlist Generator using either **Ngrok** for local/Colab-based testing or **Streamlit Cloud** for public access.

---

## 1. Deploying with Ngrok (Google Colab / Local)

Ngrok allows you to expose your local or notebook-based Streamlit app to the internet through a temporary public URL, ideal for testing or demos.

### Requirements
- Google Colab or local Jupyter Notebook
- `streamlit` and `pyngrok` installed:
```bash
!pip install streamlit pyngrok --quiet
```

### Steps (for Google Colab)

1. Write your app to `app.py` using:
```python
%%writefile app.py
# (your Streamlit app code goes here)
```

2. Start the Streamlit server in the background (silently):
```bash
!streamlit run app.py &>/dev/null &
```

3. Setup ngrok to create a public URL:
```python
from pyngrok import ngrok, conf
ngrok.kill()

# Set ngrok auth token
conf.get_default().auth_token = "your_ngrok_auth_token"
ngrok.set_auth_token("your_ngrok_auth_token")
```
> You can get your auth token from: [https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)

4. Create the public tunnel using Ngrok:
```python
from pyngrok import ngrok
public_url = ngrok.connect(addr="8501")
print("Streamlit app available at:", public_url)
```

5. Click the printed link to access the web app.

> Make sure to input your YouTube API key in the app when prompted.

## 2. Deploying with Streamlit Cloud (Public Deployment)

Streamlit Cloud allows you to deploy your app to the internet easily and without local hosting.

### Requirements
- GitHub repository with your project
- Streamlit Cloud account

### Steps

1. Push your code (`app.py`, `requirements.txt`) to a GitHub repository.
2. Visit [https://streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and sign in using your GitHub account.
3. Click **New App** then connect your GitHub repo and branch.
4. Specify the main file path, such as app.py and then click "Deploy".
5. Configure API key using **Secrets Management**:
   - In your Streamlit Cloud dashboard, add:
```toml
[api]
youtube_key = "YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY"
```
